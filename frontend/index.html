    <h2>Featured Project – Cloud Resume</h2>

      <li>Serverless backend using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB</li>
      <li>Public REST API exposed via Amazon API Gateway</li>

    <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The frontend is served from an S3 static website. JavaScript requests are sent
      to an API Gateway endpoint, which triggers a Lambda function that updates a
      DynamoDB table storing the visitor count. All components are managed as code
      using Terraform.
